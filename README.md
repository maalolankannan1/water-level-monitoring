# Chennai Water-level Monitoring
A Descriptive and Predictive Analysis on the water levels of various lakes in Chennai(As of 2019).
## Abstract
On 19 June 2019, Chennai city officials declared that "Day Zero", or the day when almost no water is left, had been reached, as all the four main reservoirs supplying water to the city had run dry. Two years of deficient monsoon rainfall, particularly in late 2017 and throughout much of 2018 had led to this crisis.
<br>There are many factors to be blamed for this crisis. Unplanned construction, land encroachment by real estate magnates, improper rainwater harvesting system are some among them.<br>
## Proposed Work
In this project we are analyzing the important water reserves of Chennai which supplies water to the entire city. So here we take a look at the survey of the current water level of various lakes (as on 26.10.2019) on comparison with the one that was observed on 19.06.2019 (The day of water crisis) to find the root cause of this water crisis and also check whether the current  water levels are sufficient for providing water for future use.

### Pie Chart

### Scatter Plots:
1. Rainfall of Redhills vs Water Level of Redhills<br>
<image src = "./OUTPUTS/Sca1.jpeg"></image><br><br>
2. Rainfall of RedHills vs Rainfall of Cholavaram<br>
<image src = "./OUTPUTS/Sca2.jpeg"></image><br><br>

## Result:
In this, we have used linear regression model between the water level and rainfall level of four different lakes.<br> 
We have unsuccessful regression between water level and rainfall in Redhills as it is not a good fit due to R2 = 0.003. While, we get successful regression between rainfall in Cholavaram and Redhills, a good plot with R2 = 0.89.
<br>For the testing of hypothesis of Cholavaram gives us the mean, which is equal to 3.5.
